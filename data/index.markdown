# Linked Open Data

Arts Holland is the primary resource for linked open data on tourism and culture in the Netherlands. The platform allows anyone to re-use the data from the linked open data collection. Arts Holland encourages you to build new creative applications and other services to provide useful information to people who come to explore culture and arts in the Randstad.

## What is Linked open data and what does it offer?

Linked open data is freely accesible data that is linked to other sources to make it more useful. Thanks to a special way of structuring data, computers are able to understand the meaning and the context, which makes searching a lot more effective and efficient. It is easier to find data, and follow relevant links to find additional contextual information. Unlocking linked open data stimulates innovation, because services can be developed that would otherwise be too expensive or technically unfeasible.

With Linked Open Data each datapoint is connected to other datapoints within the container, in a format that helps computers to understand the context of the data. Because computers understand the context, and have access to linked data from various sources it can quickly and easily return relevant information. Arts Holland encourages others to use and re-use data from the platform into relevant information for visitors of the Nederlands. In this section we explain the basics of linked open data.

Arts Holland is the first initiative in the Netherlands that gathers, opens and links data from the culture and hospitality sector. The platform contains data on cultural events, hospitality, transportation and travelers’ preferences. Since all sources are linked tourists will not only be able to find the special events that match their personal preference, but also they will easily get relevant suggestions of other things they might like in that area.

Imagine a mobile application for tourists visiting the Netherlands. When a tourist searches for ‘places of interest in Rotterdam’, the application will give suggestions based on his preferences, his current location and the time of the day. Once the visitor has chosen an activity the app tells him how to get to the venue. With a traditional search application the tourist would receive millions of documents containing the words ‘places of interest in Rotterdam’.  In that way it would be very difficult to find events beyond the highlights, and he would have to find out himselve how to get there. 

An overview of data that is already available via Arts Holland can be found here.

The more data becomes available the better the tourists will be served, leading to more visits and more expenditure in the cultural sector. Arts Holland is a growing collection and all parties with data are invited to contribute (go to contact) by making data available..

## The philosophy behind open data

Open data is data that is freely available for (re) use without copyright, patent or other restrictions. Often it is about non-textual content like maps, financial and market information.

Access to this type of data is often controlled and restricted by public and private parties. Advocates of open data argue that facts should not be copyrighted. The data itself must be free, but the services that build on data can generate value. Many people think that data, and especially data generated with public resources, should be made available without restrictions or fees.

For entrepreneurs open data implies new dynamics. Programmers can combine data from various open sources in a cheap and flexible way. Combining information can lead to new services and insights, and entrepreneurs can develop  profitable applications .

So on the one hand opening up data increases transparency and empowerment of citizens, and on the other hand it stimulates economic activity. 

## The technology behind linked data

Linked data is data on internet that is linked to other sources, in a specific structured format.

Often the expression linked data is used for data that is published according to specific ‘rules‘, in a way that it is readable and interpretable for machines. The idea is that everything on the internet can be linked to related data somewhere else on the web. Every ‘thing‘ on the internet is assigned a specific name, and its relations to other ‘things‘ is defined explicitly.

This specific structure enables machines to understand what the data is about, and search for relevant links. It can distill and display much more relevant information to users.

Theoretically, linked data need not be open for use by other users. However, in practice linked data is almost always open, because it can not really be linked if it is not shared. The Arts Holland platform offers linked open data.
