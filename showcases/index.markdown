## Museum App

The Museum App offers interactive tours with cultural experiences on your smart phone. These tours are created by various museums and are located both on the street and inside the exhibition halls. The Arts Holland platform data has been connected to the interface of the Museum app. Museums can now easily add information on events to their tours, which makes the route more interesting and up to date for tourists.

## Arts Holland Next - CitySDK

The European project CitySDK offers a structural solution for disclosing real-time open data. By joining this platform, the Dutch Arts Holland data can be linked to tourist and cultural information in other big European cities. An example of the data on the map can be found [here].(http://citysdk.waag.org/map#nodes?layer=rce.rijksmonumenten,amsterdam.hotels,bag.vbo)

## Arts Holland Travel Guide

The Arts Holland Travel Guide enables users to put together a personalised travel list, from their desktop or iPhone. Based on an agenda, disciplines, routes and a map, events and locations in the country's four main cities may be added. The personal travel list guides visitors through these cities, based on a route description. By adding personal own photos, the whole travel adventure can be personalised even further, and can be experienced again and again during and after the trip, and may be shared with friends on social media.

The app can be used both online and offline to avoid high roaming costs. The user-friendly app is fully integrated with the Arts Holland website and the Arts Holland map, and is linked to the Open Data Platform. The app can be downloaded free of charge in the iTunes App Store, and is available in English.
